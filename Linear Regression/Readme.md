## Situation

### Problem Definition
a Luxura investor and loyal Luxura user, is a fan of the Adibi brand. He asked the Luxura team to
provide his personal insight by predicting the value of Adibi's order because he had spent a lot of
money on Adibi. So my role as a data analyst is to create a Linear Regression model to
understand which variables influence Adibi's order value

### Objective

The aim of this project is to create a Linear Regression model to
understand which variables influence Adibi's order value

### Task & Actions

1. Correlation Analysis :
   - Find Independent variable with high correlation to Dependent
   - Remove Independent variables with high correlation (Non-multicollinearity)

2. Model Evaluation :
   - Partial test
   - Simultaneous Test
   - The R Square

3. Model Implementation : Regression formula implementation

### Result
- Based on the regression results, it has an R square of 61% which is a good model
- Adibi Qty of Order, Cellina Value of Order and Promotion Adibi are variables that affect Adibi Value of Order
- Provide a Tiered Discount to encourage customers to buy more Adibi. Customers will buy more than one product by giving bigger discounts as they spend more. In turn, this increases sales and average order value (AOV). How to run? :
  Match spend with typical AOVs. Since our Adibi AOV is $47.35, we can start the discount at $59.99
  - Get 10% off $59+
  - Get 20% off $119+
  - Get 30% off $239+
- Because Cellina has influence on the value of Adibi's orders, we can hold promotions or collaborate with Cellina so that their products complement each other
