## Situation

### Problem Definition

Luxura is an e-commerce company that has exclusive partnerships with top brands such as Adibi,
Balena and Cellina. In this case, all the bosses in the company wanted to prioritize Adibi because it
paid the highest fee to the company. However, Head of Data believes we need to take a look at the
purchase performance first. So my role as a data analyst is to identify whether Adibi has the best purchase performance out of the 2 brands?

### Objective

The aim of this project is to identify whether Adibi has the
best purchase performance out of the 2 brands?

### Task & Actions

Data gathering -> Collect data Luxura Purchase Data

Data Cleaning -> Use tools on Spreadsheets to clean and prepare data

Data Analysis -> Conduct EDA and
hypothesis testing to
find patterns and
insights using
XLMiner Analysis
Toolpak on
Spreadsheets

### Result

- Adibi is the product with the lowest purchase of all brands in terms of value for money, but the promotion rate is relatively the lowest. Hence, partnering with Luxura could be one of the solution to increase Adibi’s promotions
- We may need to create a membership points or member program that can increase the revenue and growth of not-married
users.
- We are also able to create promotions targeting low and middle income groups as we know that our purchasing base is made up of low to middle income groups.
- Based on the hypothesis test using the t-test, a p-value of less than 0.05 is obtained, which means we reject the null hypothesis.
- Cellina > Balena > Adibi -> significant different on average amount spent. It means that Cellina’s highest average amount
spent is absolute.
- Because Cellina has the absolutely the highest average amount spent, we could learn from Cellina’s promotion. Specifically learning on the demography of Cellina users would also be advisable.
- Because there is significant difference of average amount spent between brand, it means that brands performance are
different. Thus, the strategy to uplift Adibi amount spent would be personalized to Adibi characteristics. We need to know
further on what variables are influencing Adibi amount spent. Therefore, regression would be advised
